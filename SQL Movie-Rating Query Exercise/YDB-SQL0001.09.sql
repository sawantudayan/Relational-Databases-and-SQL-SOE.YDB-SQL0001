#Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. 
#(Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Dont just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.)



SELECT AVG(Before1980.avg) - AVG(After1980.avg)
FROM (
  SELECT AVG(stars) AS avg
  FROM Movie
  INNER JOIN Rating USING(mId)
  WHERE year < 1980
  GROUP BY mId
) AS Before1980, (
  SELECT AVG(stars) AS avg
  FROM Movie
  INNER JOIN Rating USING(mId)
  WHERE year > 1980
  GROUP BY mId
) AS After1980;
